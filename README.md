Hey, I'm Moe Kyaw Aung 👨‍💻

Android developer based in Tachileik, Myanmar.  
I love designing and building Android apps that solve real problems — from small utilities to full, API‑driven products.

Over the last few years I’ve:
- Built multiple Android apps using Kotlin, Jetpack, and Firebase  
- Explored computer vision, cybersecurity, and web technologies through hands‑on projects  
- Focused on writing clean, maintainable code and improving app UX

Here you’ll find my experiments, learning projects, and production‑ready Android apps.
